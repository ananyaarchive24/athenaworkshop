# athenaworkshop

i built this as my second project for athena.
this is my first project with react, and i feel confident enought o build more complex apps in react now since i got the hang of it while building this project

what it is - my project is a very simple dashboard that has Æ’eatures that can help you pull an all nighter easily.

why i made it - i was thinking of an idea for the second project for athena and after a lot of brainstorming i realised this would be a pretty cool project to build considering the no of increased all nighters ive been having to pull off recently (academic trenches)

this is definitely not the final version of the project since i want to add a lot more thiings, but the idea behind this whole project was basically to have a cool dashboard that can keep u company while u do something difficult. this version could be called an mvp, which i need to make a lot of improvements to, but after reaching this point i thought it was a good idea to sumbit it now, and maybe even get feedback from everyone  

it has
- a guide section that can help you pull a science based all nighter (the content inside the guides still has to be filled, since i need to research thsi information and explain it in a presentable way too
- an energy drink counter log, - this helped me learn how u build simple counters. this section was originally going to be called activity log since i wanted it to show the amount of hours you spent and how many tasks u completed throughout
- it has a to do list, where u can only add 3 tasks since people make lists with a million tasks and never complete it. if u try to add a third task, it shows a popup -> u cant add more tasks
- a simple apple like widget to show the time, and then besides it a timer for a deep work block. it is default at 90 mins since thats how much time i can usually focus for.
- and then lastly a small section to show embedded playlists from spotify that will help u stay awake

how:
- after researching a little bit, i found out react is the easiest way to build projects like this and so i installed everythiing and figured out how the project structure and files should be like. i had used react a little bit before so that helped too. but now i feel much more confident and my next project will definitely be much faster since i dont have to figure out the technical aspects of installing and setting everything up from the scratch, and even all the commands like npm start and figuring out the warnings and everything

what i struggled with 
- i originally wanted this project to have multiple themes which the user could select from (nightcore, cyberpunk, crimson0like etc) but i tried to make that work and it didnt, so another thing i want to work on.
- grid vs flexbox confusion
- i struggled a lot with trying to make it perfect, because as u can see above i wanted it to hv a lot of features but that was really blocking my progress, so i just decided to go ahead and make the simplest features first and make them work, and then decided to work on adding more things later - so now ik whenever i get started with something, i should kinda hv a rough draft first and then work on the rest of it later
- i wanted to try animations on the counter, so that took up a lot of time
